Android Fluid Experiment
=========
The idea is to help you relax by using a variety of interactive fluid simulations

This project uses the [Android Studio CMake plugin](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/external-c-builds) with C++ support.

The project is a little rough around the edges, but it demos what I set out to do - however, there are likely to be bugs and it is clearly not finished. There is a known issue that when you enter the fluid sim, and then press the back button and try to re-enter, this causes a crash. There is an issue with the C++ library that needs looking into...

--------------

Demo Video

Apologies for the poor frame rate in the video, the app itself runs very smooth! Also, I should hightlight, relaxing music is also played whilst in the fluid simulation.
